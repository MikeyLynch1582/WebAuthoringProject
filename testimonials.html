		<h2>Dromin Athlacca is one of the clubs we are working with. Dromin Athlaaca Gaa is a limerick based hurling and football club which have had various successes over the years.

The way Mikey has the company so invovled and helping out clubs such as the Kilmallock Athletics Club is unreal. He goes out of his way to go to every event and the every fundraiser and every run is amazing. We provide gear to the club which is of high quality and comfort. we love Breezy at the club and I love working for Breezy."</quote>
